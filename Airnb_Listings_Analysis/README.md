# üá´üá∑ AirBnB Listing Analysis: Paris

## Project Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of AirBnB listings in **Paris, France**. The primary goal is to uncover key factors influencing pricing, assess the quality of the listings data, and analyze the market dynamics of short-term rentals in the capital city.

---

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

The project includes several data visualizations, generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn, to illustrate key findings, such as:
* Price distribution across different neighborhoods.
* The relationship between listing capacity and price.
* Temporal trends of new host entries and average price movements.

A sample visualization is included in the project files (e.g., `image_a03643.png`).

## üéØ Goals

1.  To conduct a comprehensive **investigation of the AirBnB market structure** in Paris.
2.  To **identify the main price predictors** for listings (e.g., neighborhood, accommodation capacity).
3.  To analyze the **temporal dynamics** of the market, including the influx of new hosts and changes in average price over time since 2008.

## üìã Analysis Objectives

The analysis was structured into the following key tasks, detailed step-by-step within the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Import the main `Listings.csv` dataset, handle data types, and initial inspection.
2.  **Data Filtering:** Filter the dataset to include only listings confirmed to be located in **Paris**.
3.  **Quality Assurance (QA):** Check for missing values, calculate descriptive statistics, and handle outliers.
4.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Group listings by `neighbourhood` to determine the most and least expensive areas based on the average price.
5.  **Accommodation Capacity Analysis:** Investigate the relationship between the average price and the number of guests an apartment can accommodate (`accommodates`).
6.  **Temporal Analysis:** Create a time-series plot to visualize trends in the number of new hosts and the corresponding movement in the average listing price annually.
