# üá´üá∑ AirBnB Listing Analysis: Paris

## Project Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of AirBnB listings in **Paris, France**. The primary goal is to uncover key factors influencing pricing, assess the quality of the listings data, and analyze the market dynamics of short-term rentals in the capital city.

## üéØ Goals

1.  To conduct a comprehensive **investigation of the AirBnB market structure** in Paris.
2.  To **identify the main price predictors** for listings (e.g., neighborhood, accommodation capacity).
3.  To analyze the **temporal dynamics** of the market, including the influx of new hosts and changes in average price over time since 2008.

## üìã Analysis Objectives

The analysis was structured into the following key tasks, detailed step-by-step within the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Import the main `Listings.csv` dataset, handle data types (e.g., converting the `host_since` column to datetime objects), and initial inspection.
2.  **Data Filtering:** Filter the dataset to include only listings confirmed to be located in **Paris**.
3.  **Quality Assurance (QA):** Check for missing values, calculate descriptive statistics for numerical fields, and handle extreme outliers in the price column.
4.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Group listings by `neighbourhood` to determine the most and least expensive areas based on the average price.
5.  **Accommodation Capacity Analysis:** Investigate the relationship between the average price and the number of guests an apartment can accommodate (`accommodates`), focusing on the most expensive area.
6.  **Temporal Analysis:** Create a time-series plot to visualize trends in the number of new hosts entering the market and the corresponding movement in the average listing price annually.

## üí° Key Insights

The analysis yielded the following significant conclusions about the Parisian AirBnB market:

* **Average Price:** The overall average price per night for a listing in Paris is approximately **‚Ç¨113**.
* **Price Volatility:** The market exhibits high price variance, with the maximum observed price reaching **‚Ç¨12,000**, highlighting the presence of ultra-luxury listings.
* **Most Affordable Areas:** The most budget-friendly neighborhoods for renters are **Menilmontant** (with an average price around ‚Ç¨75) and **Buttes-Chaumont** (average price around ‚Ç¨83).
* **Capacity as a Predictor:** There is a **strong positive correlation** between the apartment's capacity (`accommodates`) and its average price, particularly in the city's most expensive areas. Larger capacity significantly drives up the cost.
* **Market Growth Trend:** The temporal analysis shows the historical growth of the platform in Paris, illustrating the years with the highest intake of new hosts and how those periods correlated with fluctuations in the city's average listing price.
